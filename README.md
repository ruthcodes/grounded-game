# grounded-game
First ever python game.

A text adventure game where the user has to navigate to their bedroom while removing clothes and putting on pyjamas, without getting caught. Each room is a function, and there are separate modules for handling user input and the 'clothing' elements of the game.

This was written before I had learned how to code classes, so it uses functions exclusively where classes would probably make more sense, and has some unecessary repetition.
